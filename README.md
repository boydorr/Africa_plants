# Africa_plants

Example for running code from the [EcoSISTEM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12257). This runs a simulation of plant biodiversity for the whole of Africa (approx. 30,000 species) using data from:

- Global Biodiversity Information Facility ([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org))
- European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int))
- Enhanced Vegetation Index from [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov)

More details on how the plant climate preferences were obtained can be found in our [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.13564)
